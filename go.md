# Overview

STEPN GO is a Web3 lifestyle app featuring social and game modules. Its goal is to connect people globally. It centers on two of the most essential daily activities: staying connected with friends and family, and maintaining an active lifestyle.

Users equip themselves with NFT Sneakers, allowing them to earn Tokens and NFTs by **walking,jogging, or running outdoors.** The Tokens and NFTs can either be used within the app or sold on secondary markets freely.

STEPN GO facilitates Web3 adoption via Sneaker Lending and FSL ID — users only require an email and an Activation Code to start playing. **FSL ID aims to be the biggest Web3 Universal Login and Loyalty Program.**

**NOTE: STEPN GO is currently in the testing phase. The content of this whitepaper is subject to change in the future.**

# Game Module

## Sneaker Attributes

### Efficiency
Efficiency impacts **GGT (GO GAME TOKEN)** earnings. Higher Efficiency results in increased GGT earnings for the Energy spent. 

GGT will **NOT** be earned once the Daily Earning Cap is reached.

### Luck
Luck influences **Mystery Box (MB)** drops. Only Sneakers of Uncommon Quality and above have a Luck value; the higher the Luck and Energy spent in a single session, the higher level Mystery Box will drop, which will contain higher quantity of Raw Stones

Mystery Boxes will **NOT** be awarded if the MB slots are full.

### Charm
Charm affects **Outfit Fragment** earnings. Outfit Fragments can be turned into different Outfits. Charm represents the social status of the user in STEPN GO, as the user's equipped Outfits can be viewed by others on the Interactive Map, or shared on social medias. 

Only Sneakers of Uncommon Quality and above have a Charm value. The higher the Charm and Energy spent in a single session, the more Outfit Fragments will drop. Rare and Legendary Outfits will have special visual effects in STEPN GO as well as in FSL's social platform in future - **The MoonBase.**

### Karma
Karma impacts **PvP earnings in GMT**, which are from the **Schadenfreude Pool**. Only Sneakers of Uncommon Quality and above possess a Karma value. The greater the Karma and Energy spent in a single session, the higher the chance of earning a fraction of the Schadenfreude Pool.

GMT earnings from the Schadenfreude Pool are set every 24 hours period, based on the PvP Leaderboard standings, and not directly after the earning session ends. Earnings are awarded only to those who rank above a certain threshold on the Leaderboard.

### Earning Toggle
Users can earn only one type of reward per session based on the 4 Attributes: Efficiency, Luck, Charm, or Karma. They can select the reward by choosing the appropriate toggle: GGT, Mystery Box, Outfit, or Schadenfreude Pool.

## Sneaker Types
There are four Sneaker Types, the faster the Optimal Speed, the higher the return. This applies to earnings with all four Attributes. Below is the comparison of the earnings of different Sneaker Types: 


| Name | Optimal Speed  |  Example Return |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| Walker | 1 - 6 km/hr | 90% |
| Jogger | 4 - 10 km/hr | 95%|
| Runner | 8 - 20 km/hr | 100% |
| Trainer | 1 - 20 km/hr | Randomised 90% ~ 110%  |

**NOTE: Earnings can be affected by GPS strength, Fitness Level, and Sneaker Attributes.**

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

#### Trial Sneakers 
* Trial Sneakers are only available to the Gift Bag recipient.
* Trial Sneakers will disappear in 14 days disregard the Gift Bag recipients' activation status. 
* Trial Sneakers is issued by the system, all Trail Sneakers are the same.

### Genesis Sneakers
STEPN GO will continue to use the Genesis Sneaker System from STEPN: Genesis Sneakers have IDs starting with a "G". STEPN and STEPN GO share one Genesis Sneaker Pool capped at a total supply of 20,000.

## Sneaker Level
Users can level up their Sneakers by burning **GGT**, with GMT being required at certain levels. Each level-up has a fixed completion time, and **only one sneaker can be levelled up at a time**. This process can be accelerated by burning additional GGT. Upon levelling up, users receive additional Attribute Points to allocate based on their Sneakers' Quality.

Higher Quality Sneakers have higher Level Cap:

| Quality 	  | Attribute Points/Level Up | Max Level |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| Common 		| 4 	| 20 |
| Uncommon 	| 6 	| 30 |
| Rare 		| 8 	| 40 |
| Epic 		| 10 	| 50  |
| Legendary 	| 12 	| 60  |

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

Additional perks will be unlocked upon reaching certain levels:

| Level 	  | Perks | Requirement |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| 4 -> 5 Common 		| N/A 	| GGT |
| 4 -> 5 Uncommon and up 	| Unlock Socket 1 | GGT +GMT |

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

## Sneaker Quality

There are five Sneaker Qualities:

| Quality | Attribute Base Value | Gem Sockets | MB Slots | Attributes |
|:---------- |:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| ----------:|
|Common|1 ~ 10|0|0|Efficiency|
|Uncommon|8 ~ 18|4|4|Efficiency, Luck, Charm, Karma|
|Rare|15 ~ 35|4|4|Efficiency, Luck, Charm, Karma|
|Epic|28 ~ 63|4|4|Efficiency, Luck, Charm, Karma|
|Legendary|50 ~ 112|4|4|Efficiency, Luck, Charm, Karma|

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

## Sneaker Minting

### What is Minting?

Minting allows users to create a new Sneaker by using two existing Sneakers. The requirements for minting are as follows:

1. One sneaker must be designated as the Left Foot and the other as the Right Foot, based on their position on the Minting Page.
1. Both Sneakers must be at least Level 10 or above.
1. GGT cost.
1. A dynamic Mint Quota is required. Mint Quota comes from Energy consumption (by the combination of the user and the user's Guest Energy consumption). 

Minting includes a 48-hour cooldown period, and each Sneaker can perform a maximum of 7 Mints in total. **The cost in GGT increases with each subsequent Mint, and similarly, the likelihood of dropping an extra Shoe box also increases**. Users can find the newly minted Shoe box in their inventory and open it immediately.

The minting costs for each Sneaker are calculated based on their Quality and are combined for the total minting cost. The cost for the first two Mints is consistent.

**NOTE: Currently GMT is NOT required for Sneaker minting, it might be in the future.**

**NOTE: Genesis Sneakers are exempt from the Left foot and Right foot rule.**

### What is a Shoe box?

A Shoe box is what users receive from the minting process instead of a Sneaker directly. Upon opening the Shoe box, users will then receive a Sneaker.

### Double Mint

There is a chance to get an extra Shoe box during Minting. More Minting on a Sneaker increases the chance of double Minting.

### The Shoe box Quality

The outcome of the Shoe box minting varies based on the Quality of the "Parent" Sneakers involved in the minting process. Here are the results based on different Quality "Parent" Sneakers:

|Sneaker Quality|Common Shoe box %|Uncommon Shoe box %|Rare Shoe box %|Epic Shoe box %|Legendary Shoe box %|
|:------ |:--------:|:--------:|:--------:| :--------:| ------:|
|Common x Common|100|0|0|0|0|
|Common x Uncommon|50|49|1|0|0|
|Common x Rare|50|0|49|1|0|
|Common x Epic|50|0|0|49|1|
|Common x Legendary|50|0|0|0|50|
|Uncommon x Uncommon|0|98|2|0|0
|Uncommon x Rare|0|49|50|1|0|
|Uncommon x Epic|0|49|1|49|1|
|Uncommon x Legendary|0|49|1|0|50|
|Rare x Rare|0|0|98|2|0|
|Rare x Epic|0|0|49|50|1|
|Rare x Legendary|0|0|49|1|50|
|Epic x Epic|0|0|0|98|2|
|Epic x Legendary|0|0|0|49|51|
|Legendary x Legendary|0|0|0|0|100|


**NOTE: Higher Sneaker Qualities will be released incrementally; therefore, users cannot obtain a higher Quality Sneaker from minting until such Quality has been officially released.**

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### Shoe Box Opening

The Quality, Type, and Socket type of the new Sneaker obtained from the Shoe box are determined by the characteristics of the "Parent" Sneakers, as outlined below:

|Shoe Box Quality|Common Sneaker %|Uncommon Sneaker %|Rare Sneaker %|Epic Sneaker box %|Legendary Sneaker box %|
|:------ |:--------:|:--------:|:--------:| :--------:| ------:|
|Common|97|3|0|0|0|
|Uncommon|25|73|2|0|0
|Rare|0|27|71|2|0|
|Epic|0|0|30|68|2|
|Legendary|0|0|0|35|65|

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### Sneaker type

| Types | Walker %| Jogger %| Runner %| Trainer %|
|:------ |:--------:|:--------:| :--------:| ------:|
|Walker x Walker|85|6|6|3|
|Walker x Jogger|45|45|7|3|
|Walker x Runner|45|7|45|3|

|Trainer x Trainer|25|25|25|25|

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

The Socket type of the new Sneaker is determined by the Socket types of the two "Parent" Sneakers.


| Parents              | Efficiency % | Luck % | Charm % | Karma % |
|----------------------|--------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Efficiency x Efficiency | 70          | 10     | 10      | 10      |
| Efficiency x Luck      | 40          | 40     | 10      | 10      |

| Karma x Karma          | 10          | 10     | 10      | 70      |

**NOTE: Common Sneaker does NOT have Socket.**

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### Minting Fee
There is a 6% minting fee.

## Mystery Box & Raw Stone
### What is a Mystery Box?
A Mystery Box (MB) is a box with a set timer counting down. Once the countdown completes, users can open the Mystery Box at **NO COST**. 

If users wish to open the Mystery Box before the countdown ends, they can do so by burning some GGT to accelerate the opening process.

Mystery Boxes come in 10 levels. Each MB can **ONLY** drop Level 1 Raw Stones in different Types, with the quantity dependent on the MB's Quality. MB content can include:

* Efficiency Raw Stone
* Luck Raw Stone
* Charm Raw Stone
* Karma Raw Stone
* Mystery Raw Stone

**NOTE: The drop rate of Mystery Boxes is not guaranteed.**

### How to earn Mystery Boxes?
Users equipped with Uncommon or higher Quality Sneakers will obtain Mystery Box slots. By choosing Mystery Box earning via the Earning Toggle and moving outdoors, they have a chance to earn a MB.

### What are Mystery Box Slots and How to get more?
A Mystery Box Slot is a designated space where users can store their earned Mystery Boxes. Users equipped with Uncommon or higher Quality Sneakers have access to four initial Mystery Box Slots. 

If a user opts to earn Mystery Boxes by pressing the corresponding toggle, one MB may be awarded and occupy a Slot after each session. If all Slots are full, the user cannot earn any additional MBs.

**Users have the option to increase their Mystery Box Slots capacity from 4 up to 8 by burning GMT.**

### What affects Mystery Box Earnings?
Mystery Box earnings are influenced by two key factors:

1. The amount of Energy used in a single session.
1. The Luck value of the Sneaker being used.

### What is a Raw Stone (RS)?
Raw Stones are the precursors of Gems: they can be levelled up or Cut. 

**NOTE: Raw Stones can be sold individually, or in stacks of 10 or 100.**

**NOTE: Raw Stones CANNOT be inserted into a Sneaker's Socket directly.**

### How to level up Raw Stones? 
Each Levelling attempt requires 3 Raw Stones of the same Type. If the attempt fails, the Raw Stones are destroyed.

| Action                        | Success Rate | Cost         |
|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Level 1 → 2 Raw Stone Upgrade | 30%          | 5 GGT + 1 GMT |
| Level 2 → 3 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 3 → 4 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 4 → 5 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 5 → 6 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 6 → 7 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 7 → 8 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 8 → 9 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%          | Free         |
| Level 9 → 10 Raw Stone Upgrade | 50%         | Free         |

**NOTE: Levelling up level 1 Raw Stones can be processed in bulk. All GGT spent by users on Raw Stones upgrade is burned.**

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### How to Cut a Raw Stone?

A Raw Stone can be cut into a Gem at a **100% success rate**.

**ONLY** cutting Mystery Raw Stones has a chance to increase by one Level, or even two Levels.  
However, there is also a chance of decreasing by one Level. Additionally, **ONLY** cutting Mystery Raw Stones can give the user a random type of Gem (from Efficiency, Luck, Charm, and Karma).

| Level | Mystery Raw Stone Cutting Outcome | Set Type Raw Stone Cutting Outcome |
|-------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Level 1 | 100% Level 1 Gem of random Type   | Level 1 Gem, same Type             |

## Gem & Socket

### What is a Gem?

A Gem can be used to increase a Sneaker’s Attribute by inserting it into a corresponding Sneaker’s Socket.

For example, only Efficiency Gems can be placed into Efficiency Sockets.

### What are the types of Gems?

There are four types of Gems, each representing a different Attribute:

1. **Yellow**: Efficiency  
2. **Blue**: Luck  
3. **Pink**: Charm  
4. **Green**: Karma  

### What are Gem levels?

Gems have 10 levels:

| Gem Level                        | Attribute | Special Effect         |
|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | +1         | +10% Base Attribute |
| 2 | +10         | +100% Base Attribute |
| 3 | +30        | +300% Base Attribute |
| 4 | +100        | +1000% Base Attribute |
| 5 | +300         | +3000% Base Attribute |
| 6 | +1000        | +10000% Base Attribute |
| 7 | +3000         | +30000% Base Attribute |
| 8 | +10000         | +100000% Base Attribute |
| 9 | +30000         | +300000% Base Attribute |
| 10 | +100000         | +1000000% Base Attribute |

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**	

### What is a Socket?

Sockets are available to Uncommon and above Quality Sneakers, the higher the Sneaker Quality, the better potential Socket Quality. Users insert Gems into the Sockets to boost the Sneakers' Attributes. They will be able to see the Socket Type without unlocking the Socket, but **NOT** the Socket Quality.

|  | Common Socket % | Uncommon Socket % | Rare Socket % | Epic Socket % | Legendary Socket % | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Common Sneaker | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| Uncommon Sneaker | 30 | 60 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 
| Rare Sneaker | 10 | 30 | 50 | 10 | 0 | 
| Epic Sneaker | 10 | 10 | 30 | 40 | 10 | 
| Legendary Sneaker | 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

Users are able to unlock Sockets by burning GGT once the Sneaker reaches Level 5/15/20/25 respectively. Higher Socket Quality will give an extra boost to the inserted Gem's Attribute:

| Socket Quality | Attribute Bonus | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Common | 100% | 
| Uncommon | 110% | 
| Rare | 120% | 
| Epic | 130% | 
| Legendary | 150% | 

**NOTE: Information in the table above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### Cost to insert and remove Gems
Inserting a Gem into a Socket is free once the Socket is unlocked. However, **removing a Gem requires burning GGT**. Alternatively, users can opt to destroy (burn) the Gem at no cost.

### Shuffle Socket Quality and Type
Users can burn GGT to shuffle the Quality and Type of **ALL** Sockets. In order to do this, they need to unlock all four Sockets and remove all inserted Gems.

## GGT Earning
### How to earn GGT?
When users move outdoors with their NFT Sneakers, they can chose to earn GGT by pressing the corresponding toggle. 

### What affects GGT Earnings?
GGT earnings are affected by the following factors:

1. Sneaker Type, Level, Efficiency Attribute value, Quality.
1. Efficiency Gem Level and corresponding Socket Quality.
1. Energy consumed.
1. Fitness Level.

### How to increase the Daily Earning Cap?
1. Users begin with a 5/5 Daily GGT Cap.
1. The cap peaks at 300/300 GGT.
1. The Daily Token Cap can be increased by levelling up Sneakers.
1. **Users can permanently increase the GGT cap beyond 300/300 by burning Gems.**The system will calculate automatically the GGT cap can increase once the user selects the Gems to burn.

## Energy & Energy Cap
### How to obtain Energy? 
Users start with zero Energy, and Energy doesn't automatically renew. However, they can acquire Energy by burning Sneakers. The amount of Energy obtained depends on the Quality of the burned Sneakers.

1. Burn 1 Common Sneaker: 90 Energy
1. Burn 1 Uncommon Sneaker: 450 Energy
1. Burn 1 Rare Sneaker: 2,250 Energy
1. Burn 1 Epic Sneaker: 11,250 Energy
1. Burn 1 Legendary Sneaker: 56,250 Energy

Energy does NOT expire and can't be traded. It's only deducted when the user consumes it.

**NOTE: Information in the list above may be subject to change during the testing phase with short notice.**

### What is the Daily Energy Cap?

Users start with zero Daily Energy Cap. The Daily Energy Cap restricts the amount of Energy a user can use in a single day. Users cannot consume Energy beyond this cap until it resets. The Daily Energy Cap will reset 50% every 12 hours.

**NOTE: When a Guest consumes Energy from the Host in the Haus, it is NOT deducted from the Host's Daily Energy Cap**

### How to increase the Daily Energy Cap?

As a user burns Sneakers to acquire Energy, the System accumulates the users' Total Energy acquired. As the Total Energy acquired reaches a certain threshold, the Daily Energy Cap increases to the next level. The maximum Energy Cap is 30/30. 

| Total Energy Acquired | Energy Cap increase | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| 90 | 0 -> 2 | 
| 270 | 2 -> 3 | 
| 450 | 3 -> 4 | 
| 720 | 4 -> 5 |

### Overheat
If a Sneaker is used to exceed the user's Daily Energy Cap, the Sneaker will enter into the Overheat status and stop working.

## Account & Achievement
### Account Level
Energy consumption & other in-app interactions will give user **Experience**. Once the user accumulates enough Experience, they will gain higher Account Level. Accounts with Higher Level might be entitled for special events, airdrops and giveaways.

### Achievement & Badge System
Each Achievement has 5 tiers of Quality. The higher the Quality, the more challenging it is to complete. Users can earn Badges by completing Achievements in the Achievement tab or by participating in in-app events. Certain Achievement Badges are tradable in the marketplace.

**NOTE: The STEPN GO's Achievement and Badge System will mirror the STEPN's Achievement and Badge System, so that for future Achievement and Badge gated event, both STEPN and STEPN GO users will have equal access**.

# Fitness Module

## Fitness Level
### Fitness Level
Each user undergoes a 14-day fitness journey that mimics real-life fluctuations in terms of GGT, Mystery Boxes, PvP, and Item Fragment Earnings. The purpose of this Fitness Level system is to encourage consistent outdoor exercise by rewarding active users and motivating inactive users to become more active.

### Special Effects
As users engage in their 14-day fitness journey, they will experience varying special effects following the order of: SOFT FEET -> SORE FEET -> STRONG FEET. The detail of these special effects are outlined below:

1. SOFT FEET (100% Earnings): This stage marks the beginning of the user experience, where fresh users or those returning from inactivity start. The user will progress through the fitness journey by using at least 2 Energy each day.
1. SORE FEET (50% to 150% Earnings): After progressing for a few days, the user will experience a reduction in earnings, decreasing to as low as 50%. However, if they continue to progress, their earnings will increase to 150%.
1. STRONG FEET (150% Earnings): By the 14th day of using at least 2 Energy each day, the user will reach the STRONG FEET stage and earn 150%. They will maintain the STRONG FEET status as long as they consume at least 2 Energy in one day every 5 days, otherwise they will start to regress back to SORE FEET. 

There are two extreme special effects:

1. PAPER FEET: If a user is inactive for more than 60 consecutive days, they will receive the PAPER FEET effect, which results in a 90% reduction in earnings. This 90% reduction in earnings will go directly into the Schadenfreude Pool. To revert to the SOFT FEET status, the user must use 120 Energy in 30 days. While under the PAPER FEET effect, they cannot sell or transfer any assets until the effect is lifted.
1. DIAMOND FEET: If a user remains active and uses at least 2 Energy daily for 1,000 accumulated days without Fitness Level regression, they will receive a permanent DIAMOND FEET effect. This effect exempts the user from the PAPER FEET, SORE FEET, and SOFT FEET effects, providing a significant long-term incentive for consistent activity. 

## Fitness Quests
Quests are one-off events, and completing them can earn **Experience** to increase a user's Account Level. Quests are available for a limited time only. 

The first Quest to be released is the Quest to unlock the Haus. More Quests will be added in the future.

### Quests to unlock the Haus:

1. Burn 2 Sneaker in exchange for Energy
1. Use 10 Energy (and get an Activation Code)

# Social Module

## The Haus
### What is the Haus?
The Haus is a feature where users can lend their Sneaker or Energy to their friends and family members. For every 10 Energy used, users gain the ability to generate a new Activation Code to lend their Sneakers. Alternatively, user can share 60 or 600 Energy to their friends and family to trial STEPN GO. Users can manage the following within the Haus:

1. The Invite, Energy Share & Activation Code System
1. The Guest Management System
1. The Gift Bag Management System
1. Haus Tier & Crest System
1. Total Mint Quota Display

### Who is the Host and how to become one?
**The Host is the owner of a Haus**. Users must complete the Haus Quests located at the top right corner of the Home Page to become eligible to set up their own Haus. Once a user establishes their Haus, they can start lending Sneakers and Energy to their Guests.

### Guest Management System

You can invite up to 5 Guests. By doing so, you are **LENDING** your Sneakers and Energy to them, and you can see their status in your Haus:

1. Press the "+" next to the Activation Code.
1. Select the "Invite a Guest" option.
1. Choose a Sneaker to lend to your Guest.
1. Determine the amount of daily Energy allocated to your Guest (between 2 and 4 Energy).
1. Decide on the earnings split percentage (between 0% and 100%).
1. Set the duration (between 2 and 4 weeks).

| | |
|---|---|
| Sneaker rule    | Guests can ONLY receive Common Sneakers. Buddies can receive ANY Sneaker Quality. |
| Energy sharing rule    | Daily Energy allocated to the Guest comes from the Host's own Energy Pool and will NOT be deducted from their Daily Energy Cap. A Host can share Energy up to the Host's Daily Energy cap to the Guest. Each Energy not spent by the Guests will be refunded to the Host afterward. |
| Earning collection rule    | The Host MUST consume a minimum of 2 Energy daily in order to collect earnings from the Haus. Otherwise, the earnings will be sent to the Schadenfreude Pool. |
| Earning Cap rule    | Earnings from the Guests DO NOT count towards the Host's Daily Earning Cap. |
| Duration rule    | Host arcs allowed to terminate the bonding if the Guest is non-performing. |
| Capacity rule    | Each Haus can accommodate up to five Guests. |

**NOTE: By lending your Sneakers to your Guest, you CAN retrieve the Sneaker at the end of the duration.**

**NOTE: Users can only lend Common quality Sneaker.**

### Gift Bag Management System

By putting 60 or 600 Energy into a Gift Bag (QR code), you can gift 6 Energy to 10 or 100 Gift Bag recipients that lasts 14 days. Upon scanning the QR code, the Gift Bag recipients will receive a Trial Sneaker to use the 6 Energy. Upon spending the Energy, the Gift Bag recipient will earn locked GGT, there are several scenarios:

1. The Gift Bag recipients buy one Sneaker from the Marketplace before QR code expires, the locked GGT or the balance of the 6 Energy will be unlocked; the Gift Bag sharer will receive 6% of the first Sneaker purchase and 2% of all future Marketplace trading of the Gift Bag recipients in GMT. The 6 Energy will NOT be returned. 
1. The Gift Bag recipients receive a Sneaker from someone else before QR code expires, the Gift Bag sharer will receive 6% of the first Sneaker purchase when it happens and 2% of all future Marketplace trading in GMT. The 6 Energy will be returned. 
1. The Gift Bag recipients do not buy one Sneaker from the Marketplace before QR code expires, the locked GGT will be erased, and the 6 Energy will be returned.

Once the QR code expires, the Gift Bag recipients account will be in inactive status. In case the account is reactivated, the Gift Bag sharer will always receive 2% from the Gift Bag recipients' Marketplace trading. 

**NOTE: Transfer Sneaker costs 6 Energy. There is no cool down for all transferred Sneaker.**

### Haus Crest & Quality System

#### Haus Crest

Depending on the Quality of the user's Haus, different styles of Crests can be selected. The higher the Haus Quality, the more options available. Users also have the option to customise their Crest.

#### Haus Tier

As Host and Gift Bag recipients of the Haus spend in the Marketplace, the Host can level up their Haus to the next tier. With a higher tiered Haus, a more prestigious Haus Crest is displayed, which each member of the Haus can wear, and more perks will be unlocked:

1. Tier 1: Haus
1. Tier 2: Manor
1. Tier 3: Fortress
1. Tier 4: Castle
1. Tier 5: Palace

## 3D Avatar & Outfit

### Outfit Crafting

#### Common Outfits

Common Outfits are divided into two different categories: the **Single Outfits**, which stand alone; and the Set Outfits, which form an integrated appearance when a user collects all 8/8 outfits.

To get them, users need to craft their OF:

1. All Common Outfit Crafting has a 100% success rate.

1. For each Rare & Legendary Outfit Crafting, users will receive **ONE** random type of Rare or Legendary Outfit.
1. A higher amount of OF is required.

## Schadenfreude Pool & PvP
### Schadenfreude Pool
The Schadenfreude Pool accumulates earnings from the following sources:

1. All of frozen earnings from accounts flagged for cheating (The DEX automatically converts GGT to GMT).
1. All of the reduced earnings from PAPER FEET (The DEX automatically converts GGT to GMT).
1. All of the reduced Host earnings for failing to meet the minimum requirement of using 2 Energy per day (The DEX automatically converts GGT to GMT).
1. GMT in the Decentralised Liquidity Pool.

### PvP & Leaderboard
In PvP, users compete against each other to earn from the Schadenfreude Pool. To have a chance at earning, users must move using Sneakers with high Karma. 

Earnings are not settled immediately after a running session ends. Instead, users are placed on a Leaderboard, and earnings are distributed at the end of the day (**between UTC 00:00 and UTC 01:00**) based on their rankings. Users must rank above a certain threshold to qualify for earnings. The higher a user's position on the Leaderboard, the greater the percentage of earnings they receive.

Users can view the Sneakers and nationalities of the 10 players ranked immediately above and below them on the Leaderboard.

**NOTE: There is NO Earning Cap for GMT**.

## Social & Interactive Map
### Localised Social Features
1. Visibility on the Interactive Map: Users can turn themselves visible on the Interactive Map, allowing other users to browse through their 3D Avatars and Outfits.
1. Chat Box: Users can drop a Chat Box on the Map to interact with others.
1. Running Invitations: Users can place Running Invitations on the Map to invite others to join them for exercise sessions by burning GGT. Other users must register to participate, and a penalty applies for those who do not show up.
1. Friendship and Communication: Users can add each other to their friend lists and engage in chats.

### Non-local Social Features
1. Shake and Match: Users can shake their phone, prompting the system to match them with someone who shares a similar exercise intensity. This facilitates the opportunity to chat and organise remote joint running sessions.
1. Friendship and Communication: Users can add each other to their friend lists and engage in chats.

## Events
STEPN GO will publish both online and offline events through the Event Page, allowing the community to meet and interact in various settings.

# Infrastructure Module

## SMAC Cheating Detection
### Moonwalking
STEPN GO relies on GPS for functionality. In areas with weak GPS signals, users might experience a status known as Moonwalking, where they neither earn rewards nor face penalties for cheating.

If a user experiences Moonwalking, they should seek open ground to improve GPS strength.

**NOTE: Moonwalking is not considered as cheating.**

### What is SMAC? 
SMAC, which stands for STEPN Model for Anti-Cheating, is a patented machine learning anti-cheating mechanism developed by FSL. It is designed to ensure fair play within the STEPN GO environment.

To combat cheating, three primary mechanisms are employed, which can result in penalties to the cheater's account:

1. Desensitized GPS data
1. Motion sensor and health data
1. A machine-learning STEPN’s Anti-Cheating System (SMAC)

After users end their session, the SMAC System initiates a detailed analysis to determine if there has been any exploitation of STEPN GO mechanics.

Using devices that have been jailbroken, rooted, or have an altered operating system can cause STEPN GO to function improperly. It is important to note that assistance will NOT be provided to retrieve any lost assets resulting from the use of GPS spoofing or hackware.

SMAC is on its Gen-7 version known as **SMAC-7** and `FSL will continuously improve the reliability and accuracy of the SMAC system`.

### SMAC-7 Guideline

SMAC-7 intelligently handles a wide range of common yet unintentional irregularities that may occur during use, such as using the app close to buildings, under trees, or in areas with weak GPS signals. It is also equipped to discern when the app is inadvertently left running, for example, while driving or when users are part of a running group. 

Users who maintain high Turing Scores (TS) and face misjudgments concerning Abnormal Runs will have the option to appeal to the FSL customer support team.

### SMAC-7 General Rules

1. The Turing Score (TS) will be displayed through a Traffic Light System for all users. 
1. All users begin with a TS of 100, which can increase to a maximum of 120.
1. Judgments include: Pass (human), Abnormal Run, Multi-devices, and Bot-hack. 
1. Every run session is checked by SMAC-7, even if the result is not displayed in the user’s interface.
1. For every four Energy consumption that pass the SMAC judgment, the TS will increase by 1.
1. TS will decrease for judgments involving Abnormal Runs or Multi-device use.
1. A Bot-hack judgment will lead to an immediate ban. 

**NOTE: These are the initial SMAC Gen-7 Rules being made public, and they may be amended with short notice**

### SMAC-7 Rules on Guest

If the Guest is judged by SMAC-7 to have an Abnormal run or Multi-device, the total earnings of the running session will be sent to the Schadenfreude Pool. 

If the Guest is judged by SMAC-7 to be bot-hack, the Guest's account will be immediately banned, and the Sneaker and remaining Energy will be returned to the Host. The Sneaker will be locked for 48 hours for manual investigation. For further suspicious and malicious activity, the FSL team will make individual judgments on a case-by-case basis. Punishments can range from a reduction in TS to an account ban.

### Traffic Light System
Green Light (81-120 TS): Users are allowed to withdraw assets.

Red Light (0-80 TS): Withdrawal of assets is restricted.

### Manual Review
Manual reviews are conducted in two scenarios: 

1. Manual review available upon user appeal.
1. Periodic and random review.

Deducted TS from erroneously judged sessions will be fully restored. Confirmed bot-hack activities will result in an immediate account ban.

### SMAC-7 Judgments Rules

**Low Severity: Abnormal Run**
